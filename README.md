### WIP!!

## Before running project:
    *GitHub access token*: An access token is needed. Can be generated following this steps:
    - Visit [GitHub settings/personal tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) and generate a fine-grained token. It needs permission for public repositories (read-only)

## ENV
    - Create .env file and replace 

    'your-access-token-here' 

    with your recently generated token.
